# Electric-Motor-Temprature-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the temperature of an electric rotor motor using various operational parameters. By analyzing sensor data, we aim to build a robust model that can accurately estimate rotor temperature, which is crucial for optimizing motor performance, preventing overheating, and extending its lifespan.
